# Exercise 1.2. Write Python code to evaluate these expressions.
# The answers can be stored in a name, or evaluated in a print statement

# 1. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?

minutes = 42
seconds = 42
answer = minutes * 60 + seconds 
print (str(answer) + " seconds")

# 2. How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61
# kilometers in a mile.

km = 10
miles = 1.61
result = km / miles
print(str(result) + " miles is " + str(km) + " kilometeters")

# 3. If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your
# average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average
# speed in miles per hour?

results = answer / result
total = result / 60
print(total)
